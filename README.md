🧠 State Management Choice

Zustand was chosen because:

Minimal boilerplate

Easy to reason about

No heavy reducers or actions

Clean separation of domain stores

🔐 Security Placeholder

Every stored entity includes a tenant_id

No real authentication is implemented (as per requirements)

📝 Notes

A mock alert stream is used instead of a real backend

The app was tested by:

Turning airplane mode ON

Capturing downtime and maintenance actions

Restarting the app

Reconnecting to the network and observing auto-sync

Expo was chosen for faster iteration and easy access to device features

🔮 What I’d Ship Next

Background sync service

Real-time alerts using SSE/WebSockets

Dark mode and localization support

Analytics dashboard for supervisors
